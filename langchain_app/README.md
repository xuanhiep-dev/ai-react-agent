# RAG-LangChain

This repository demonstrates how to build a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline using **LangChain**, **OpenAI** or **Gemini LLMs**, and vector databases (e.g., FAISS, Qdrant, Pinecone, Chroma).  

RAG combines **semantic search** and **generative AI** to provide answers that are **up-to-date, source-grounded, and context-aware**.  
In this project, the pipeline is applied to **research data querying**, enabling efficient retrieval and summarization of academic or technical documents.

## Key Features
- **RAG workflow**: Retrieve relevant context and generate precise answers.  
- **Pluggable Vector Stores**: FAISS, Qdrant, Pinecone, Chroma.  
- **Modular Tool Functions**: PDF/document loader, vector search utilities.  
- **ReAct Agent**: Dynamic tool calling with reasoning + acting loop.  
- **LangChain Agents & Chains**: Core orchestration for retrieval and generation.  
- **Research Data Querying**: Optimized for academic papers, reports, and domain-specific knowledge bases.

## Example Use Case
ðŸ‘¤ **User Query:**
*What are the recent advances in using multimodal AI for cancer diagnosis?*  

**Context (from retrieved papers):**  
- *Paper 1 (Nature Medicine, 2023)*: A fusion method combining vision methods and LLMs for radiology reports.  
- *Paper 2 (arXiv:2401.56789, 2024)*: Contrastive pretraining with paired MRI scans and clinical notes.  

ðŸ¤– **Chatbot Answer:**  
> Recent research for cancer diagnosis has focused on two promising approaches:  
> 1. **Visionâ€“Language Fusion Models** â€“ Vision are combined with large language models to jointly interpret imaging data and generate clinically grounded reports, improving diagnostic accuracy and interpretability.  
> 2. **Contrastive Pretraining with Paired Data** â€“ Aligning MRI scans with corresponding clinical notes enables richer multimodal representations, outperforming traditional CNN-based systems in tumor detection and classification.  
>
> Together, these approaches mark a shift toward **integrated reasoning**, enabling AI systems to deliver more accurate, explainable, and context-aware diagnostic support.
