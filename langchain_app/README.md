# RAG-LangChain

This repository demonstrates how to build a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline using **LangChain**, **OpenAI** or **Gemini LLMs**, and vector databases (e.g., FAISS, Qdrant, Pinecone, Chroma).  

RAG combines **semantic search** and **generative AI** to provide answers that are **up-to-date, source-grounded, and context-aware**.  
In this project, the pipeline is applied to **research data querying**, enabling efficient retrieval and summarization of academic or technical documents.

## Key Features
- **RAG workflow**: Retrieve relevant context and generate precise answers.  
- **Pluggable Vector Stores**: FAISS, Qdrant, Pinecone, Chroma.  
- **Modular Tool Functions**: PDF/document loader, vector search utilities.  
- **ReAct Agent**: Dynamic tool calling with reasoning + acting loop.  
- **LangChain Agents & Chains**: Core orchestration for retrieval and generation.  
- **Research Data Querying**: Optimized for academic papers, reports, and domain-specific knowledge bases.

## Example Use Case
```
**Input Query** 
<Your question>
**Retrieved Context (from list of papers)**  
- *Paper 1*: A fusion method combining vision methods and LLMs for radiology reports.  
- *Paper 2*: Contrastive pretraining with paired MRI scans and clinical notes.  
**Generated Answer**
```

## Real-World Applications
- **Academic Research**: Query and summarize scientific papers with source grounding.  
- **Medical AI**: Retrieve and contextualize multimodal medical studies.  
- **Legal/Policy Analysis**: Explore large legal corpora with semantic QA.  
- **Enterprise Knowledge Management**: Intelligent assistants over internal documents.

## Tech Stack
- **LangChain** – Agents, Chains, Document loaders  
- **LLMs** – OpenAI GPT, Gemini, HuggingFace models  
- **Vector Stores** – FAISS, Qdrant, Pinecone, Chroma  
- **ReAct Framework** – Reasoning + Acting loop
